# Detecting Gaps in Electronic Devices to Assist Autonomous Disassembly Processes

## Launching

* Using the stereo camera: `roslaunch ugoe_gap_detection_ros ugoe_gap_detection_ros.launch`

* Using a bagfile: `roslaunch ugoe_gap_detection_ros ugoe_gap_detection_ros.launch bag:=true bag_file:="/PATH/TO/ROSBAG.bag"`<br/>(The rosbag output is currently supressed for debugging reasons.)
